    <string name="how_to_play">Playground Wars is based off of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.
        The diagram below shows the hierarchy of what beats what. The units generally all have 2
        movement points and 10 health except Rock which has 1 movement point and has 15 health.
        The tiles on the map have different features, if a unit ends its turn on a lava tile then at
        the start of the players next turn the unit will take 2 damage. After the game is over the
        score is calculated based off how many units are remaining and if it\'s in the top 3 scores
        of the game then it will be recorded globally for all to see in the high score table.</string>
    <string name="darth_plagius">Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? It\'s a
        Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could
        use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create...life. He had such a knowledge of
        the Dark Side, he could even keep the ones he cared about...from dying. He became so powerful,
        the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power...which, eventually of course, he did.
        Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him
        in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death...but not himself.</string>
